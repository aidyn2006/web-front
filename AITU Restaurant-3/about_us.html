            <h2>The Founding of AITU Restaurant</h2>
            <p>It all began in a bustling classroom at the Astana IT University, where a group of passionate students gathered around a table, dreaming not of the latest technological breakthrough, but of something more traditional—food. Among them was Aidar, a young student with a deep love for his Kazakh heritage and an equally strong interest in global cuisine.</p>
            <p>Between coding classes and late-night study sessions, Aidar often found himself discussing food with his friends. They would share stories of home-cooked meals, talk about the lack of diverse dining options in the city, and imagine a place that could bring people together to celebrate both Kazakh traditions and international flavors.</p>

            <p>One cold winter night, after a particularly long study session, the idea hit Aidar like lightning: "What if we opened a restaurant? Not just any restaurant, but one that celebrates our culture and embraces the world’s cuisines."</p>
            <p>His friends laughed at first, thinking it was just a joke. But as Aidar shared his vision, their excitement grew. Soon, the idea of opening a place where people could come together for той (celebrations) and enjoy dishes from across the globe became more than just a dream—it was a mission.</p>

            <p>With the support of their university and a small loan, Aidar and his friends began turning their vision into reality. They called it AITU Restaurant, a tribute to their alma mater and the spirit of innovation that had brought them together.</p>
            <p>Today, AITU Restaurant is known not just as a place to eat, but as a hub for the community—a space where every meal is a celebration of heritage, diversity, and the entrepreneurial spirit that started it all.</p>
